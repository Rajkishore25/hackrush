Project Title

JobShield AI — Explainable Recruitment Scam Detection with Company Legitimacy Verification and Risk Fusion Scoring

Problem Context

Recruitment fraud via WhatsApp, email, Telegram, and unofficial job channels has become a major cybersecurity and fintech threat. Scam job offers typically exhibit:

Linguistic manipulation patterns

Unrealistic compensation signals

Fake company impersonation

Unverified recruiter identity

Requests for monetary transactions

Existing job portals lack real-time fraud scoring, company authenticity validation, and explainable scam intelligence.

Objective

Develop an end-to-end AI-based fraud detection system that performs:

NLP-driven scam classification

Entity-level company verification

Behavioral anomaly scoring (salary + urgency)

Multi-factor risk fusion

Explainable evidence highlighting

Automated forensic PDF reporting

The platform must be deployable as an interactive hackathon-ready web dashboard.

✅ System Architecture & Technical Workflow

1. Multi-Channel Input Ingestion Layer

Support structured and unstructured recruitment content from:

Email body text

WhatsApp/Telegram chat messages

Job description snippets

Optional OCR-extracted text from screenshots

All inputs are normalized into a unified document schema.

2. NLP Preprocessing & Feature Engineering Pipeline

Text Standardization

Unicode normalization

Stopword removal

Lemmatization

Noise filtering (URLs, phone numbers, emojis)

Feature Extraction Approaches

TF-IDF vectorization (baseline)

Word embeddings (Sentence-BERT optional)

Keyword-based risk token encoding

3. Supervised Scam Classification Models

Train and benchmark multiple ML classifiers:

Logistic Regression (baseline benchmark)

Decision Tree (interpretable rule induction)

K-Nearest Neighbors (similarity-based detection)

Random Forest (ensemble robustness)

Gradient Boosting / XGBoost (state-of-the-art tabular NLP performance)

Evaluation Metrics

Precision / Recall (fraud-sensitive)

F1-score

ROC-AUC

Confusion Matrix analysis

The best-performing model is selected via cross-validation.

4. Hybrid Fraud Rule Engine (High-Confidence Triggers)

In parallel with ML, implement deterministic fraud heuristics for known scam signatures:

“Pay registration/interview fee”

“Instant offer without screening”

“Urgent joining within 24 hours”

“HR contacting only via WhatsApp”

Suspicious payment/wallet instructions

This creates a hybrid AI system:

Statistical classification + rule-based enforcement

Improving reliability under limited hackathon datasets.

5. Company Legitimacy Verification Module

Perform real-time company authenticity checks using public registries:

Primary Source

OpenCorporates API lookup

Jurisdiction match

Active/inactive status

Incorporation timestamp

Registered identifier

Secondary Validation Signals

Email domain-company name consistency

Website age + SSL presence (lightweight)

Output: Company Existence Confidence Score

6. Recruiter Identity & Social Trust Scoring

Instead of illegal LinkedIn scraping, implement a compliance-safe validation layer:

Recruiter email trust score (Gmail vs corporate domain)

Optional LinkedIn profile link submission

Rule-based profile credibility scoring:

Company association

Account maturity

Network presence (manual input)

7. Compensation Anomaly Detection Layer

Detect unrealistic salary offers using market-aligned benchmarks:

Compare offered salary vs expected distribution

Static dataset reference (Glassdoor/Kaggle ranges)

Techniques:

Z-score deviation

Quantile-based anomaly scoring

Output: Salary Plausibility Index

8. Risk Fusion Engine (Unified Fraud Score)

Fuse heterogeneous risk signals into a final probabilistic scam score:

Inputs

ML fraud probability

Rule-engine trigger weight

Company verification confidence

Recruiter trust score

Salary anomaly score

Output

Scam Probability: 0–100%

Risk Tier Classification:

Low Risk

Moderate Risk

High Scam Likelihood

Critical Fraud Pattern

This is essentially a lightweight fraud scoring system similar to fintech risk engines.

9. Explainable AI & Evidence Attribution

Provide transparency through:

Suspicious phrase highlighting

Feature importance extraction (tree-based models)

Explanation breakdown:

Example:

Company not found in registry

Scam keyword triggers detected

Salary anomaly score high

Recruiter domain mismatch

This improves interpretability for judges and end-users.

10. Automated Forensic Report Generation (PDF Output)

Generate a structured fraud analysis report using ReportLab:

Scam score summary

Risk classification

Evidence markers

Company verification outcome

Recommended user action:

Ignore

Proceed with caution

Report immediately

A downloadable PDF is produced by default after each scan.

11. Ethical Scam Reporting Module (Hackathon-Safe)

Avoid public blacklisting due to legal constraints.

Instead, implement:

Internal flagged scam repository

User-driven “Report Suspicious Offer” feature

Analytics dashboard showing scam patterns (demo dataset)
